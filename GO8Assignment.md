For this weeks assignment you and your team will complete a series of small JavaScript assignments in your browser. You can open the developer tools by pressing F12 in Windows (Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox) or Cmd + Opt + I on Mac (Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox). Notable tools within this kit (for this assignment) are the "Elements" and "Console" tabs. In short, the "Elements" tab is a way of viewing the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) of a website. The "Console" tab is an active JavaScript console. The JavaScript already downloaded when accessing a website can access the console, but after the page is done loading the console can be used to still use JavaScript (these scripts will only be run on your computer and will not affect anyone else).

The assignments can be found here under this text. The page you will be completing your assignments in can be found here (LINK TO GO.HTML). Don't worry if the console logs "undefined" often! This is a standard return value for many functions.
